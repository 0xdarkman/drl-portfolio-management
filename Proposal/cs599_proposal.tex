    \section{Motivation}
    
    \section{Problem Definition}
    In this project, we would like to optimize a short term portfolio based on supervised learning results of the market. Concretely, we define $S$ as a set of stocks we want to invest. At timestamp 0, we have an initial investment volume of $M$ dollars and we don't hold any stocks. At timestamp $t$, we assume the stock we hold is $h_{p_1}, h_{p_2}, \cdots, h_{p_l}$. The action space at timestamp $t$ is $\{b_{i_1}, b_{i_2},\cdots, b_{i_n}, s_{j_1}, s_{j_2}, \cdots, s_{j_m}\}$, where each $b_{i_k}$ represents the amount we buy stock $i_k$, $k=1, 2, \cdots, n$ and each $s_{j_k}$ represents the amount we sell stock $j_k$, $k=1, 2, \cdots, m$. The action defined above is subject to $\sum_{k=1}^{n}b_{i_k}\leq M_t$, where $M_t$ is the investment volume at timestamp $t$. Also, $\{j_1, j_2, \cdots, j_m\}\subset\{p_1, p_2, \cdots, p_l\}$ and $s_{j_k}\leq h_{j_k}$, $k=1, 2, \cdots, m$. Assume the price of stock $i$ at timestamp $t$ is $P_{i, t}$, then $M_{t+1} = M_{t} - \sum_{k=1}^{n}b_{i_k} + \sum_{k=1}^{m}(P_{j_k, t} - \overline{B_{j_k}})$, where $B_{j_k}$ is the average price we buy for stock $j_k$ before timestamp $t$. 
    
    The problem is short term portfolio optimization. Thus, we constrain our investment to be in timestamp $0, 1, \cdots, T$ and the goal is to maximize the investment volume at timestamp $T$.
    
    Since we are modeling real world market trades, we make several assumptions to simplify the problems:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item We can get any information about the stocks before timestamp $t$ for stock $i$. e.g. The previous stock price, the news and tweets online.
      \item Our investment will not change how the market behaves. That is, we can do it in a fully supervised manner instead of using adversarial and reinforcement learning.
      \item At timestamp $t+1$, the stock price of all previous timestamps become ground truth. This means we can adjust our model along with the investment.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \section{Datasets and Methods}
    It has been studied in \cite{social_relation_sentiment_analysis} that social sentiments reflect how stock market behaves.
